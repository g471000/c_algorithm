This is a simple Maze Solver Exercise.
The program will print maze board that is hard-coded, and then it will show the visited path until escape.
It used stack to trace next steps.

In the future, it can be developed with...
- Auto generated maze board
- Animated maze shown on the screen in real time (with some sleep)

To run this program
```
gcc maze.c -o maze.o
./maze.o
```
