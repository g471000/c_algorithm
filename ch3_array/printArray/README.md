To run this program, create an execution file and then run: 
```
gcc print_array.c -o print_array.o 
./print_array.o
```

This will show address of elements in a array with 5 numbers. The output should look like below (but the address will be different):
```
--Address----Value---
---------------------
 3953109504    0
 3953109508    1
 3953109512    2
 3953109516    3
 3953109520    4
```
